**Mumbai** — Meesho, India's social commerce pioneer, enjoyed a triumphant first day as a public company, with shares surging as much as 46% above the issue price. The strong debut reflects growing investor enthusiasm for India's e-commerce sector and validates the company's unique approach to serving price-conscious consumers.

The stock opened at ₹162.50, significantly above the issue price of ₹111, and reached a high of ₹171.84 during trading. At peak valuation, Meesho commanded a market capitalization of ₹780 billion (approximately $8.69 billion)—a substantial increase from its $5 billion private valuation in 2021.

## Successful Public Offering

The company raised $606 million through the IPO, marking India's first major e-commerce listing. Several early investors, including Elevation Capital, Peak XV Partners, and Y Combinator, sold their stakes during the offering. However, major backers SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity retained their positions, signaling continued confidence in the company's prospects.

## From WhatsApp to Market Leader

Founded in 2015, Meesho began as a WhatsApp-based social commerce platform targeting first-time online shoppers in smaller Indian cities. The company has successfully carved out a distinctive niche by focusing on a low-cost marketplace model that connects small merchants with value-conscious consumers across India's tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

This strategy has enabled Meesho to compete effectively against established giants like Amazon and Flipkart. The company's impressive metrics include:

- 234.2 million transacting users in the past 12 months
- 706,471 annual sellers on the platform
- Over 50,000 active content creators

"Ringing the bell generally means trading," said Meesho co-founder and CEO Vidit Aatrey during the listing ceremony. "But today, for me at Meesho, for everyone at Meesho, this ringing basically means that our mission is not just our mission. Now it's everyone's mission."

## Financial Performance

In the six months ended September 30, Meesho generated revenue of ₹55.78 billion (approximately $620.3 million), up from ₹43.11 billion the previous year. Net merchandise value surged 44% to ₹191.94 billion (about $2.14 billion) during the same period.

However, the company's losses widened to ₹4.33 billion (roughly $48.2 million), compared with ₹0.24 billion a year earlier—a common pattern for high-growth e-commerce platforms investing heavily in expansion.

## Market Implications

Meesho's successful IPO could pave the way for other Indian e-commerce companies to access public markets. The strong investor response demonstrates confidence in India's digital economy and the potential for companies that effectively serve the country's diverse consumer base.

As India's internet user base continues to expand and smartphone adoption accelerates, platforms like Meesho that cater to price-sensitive consumers in emerging markets are well-positioned for continued growth.
