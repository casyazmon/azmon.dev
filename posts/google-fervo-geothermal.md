**San Francisco** — Fervo Energy, a pioneer in enhanced geothermal technology, has raised $462 million in a Series E funding round to accelerate development of its groundbreaking geothermal power plants. The investment will help address the surging electricity demands of power-hungry data centers and AI infrastructure.

The funding will enable Fervo to complete its flagship 500-megawatt Cape Station power plant in Utah while initiating development on several additional sites, according to Sara Jewett, the company's senior vice president of strategy.

## **Impressive Investor Lineup**

The round was led by B Capital and attracted participation from a diverse group of investors, including:

- AllianceBernstein, Atacama Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures
- Major institutional investors CalSTRS and CPP Investments
- Technology partners Google and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
- Energy sector players Devon Energy and Mercuria
- Climate-focused funds including Climate First and Carbon Equity

Google's participation is particularly notable, as the tech giant has an existing agreement with Fervo to supply electricity for its data centers—a critical need as AI workloads drive unprecedented energy consumption.

## **Rapid Progress on Cape Station**

Fervo has targeted 2026 to bring the first phase of Cape Station online, and Jewett confirmed the project will be "mechanically complete" this year. "It's very real and very tangible," she emphasized.

The new funding follows a $206 million financing package announced just six months ago, which included loans and project-level preferred equity for Cape Station. Last year alone, Fervo raised nearly $500 million in combined equity and debt.

## **Enhanced Geothermal's Moment**

Enhanced geothermal technology has been in development for years but is now experiencing a renaissance as favorable market conditions align. Unlike traditional geothermal plants that rely on naturally occurring hot water reservoirs, enhanced geothermal systems create artificial reservoirs by fracturing hot rock formations deep underground.

This approach dramatically expands the potential locations for geothermal power generation, making it possible to tap into the Earth's heat in regions previously unsuitable for conventional geothermal energy.

As tech companies race to power their AI infrastructure with clean energy, Fervo's technology offers a promising solution: reliable, carbon-free baseload power that operates 24/7, unlike intermittent solar and wind sources.

The company's progress represents a significant milestone in the broader transition to renewable energy, particularly for energy-intensive industries seeking sustainable power solutions.
