**New Delhi** — Amazon has unveiled plans to invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, marking one of the largest foreign investment commitments in the country's technology sector. This brings the company's total planned investment in India to approximately $75 billion.

The announcement comes as tech giants race to establish stronger footholds in India's rapidly growing digital economy, which boasts over a billion internet users and hundreds of millions of smartphone users.

## Strategic Investment Focus

The new capital will primarily support Amazon's efforts to digitize small businesses across India and expand its logistics infrastructure. The company has set ambitious targets, including:

- Enabling AI access for up to 15 million small businesses
- Creating 1 million jobs (direct, indirect, induced, and seasonal) by 2030
- Expanding cloud operations through Amazon Web Services (AWS)

According to a report by Keystone Strategy, Amazon has already invested nearly $40 billion in India to date. The company's 2023 commitment included $12.7 billion earmarked specifically for AWS cloud infrastructure.

## Competitive Landscape Intensifies

Amazon's announcement follows similar moves by other tech giants. Microsoft recently committed $17.5 billion to India by 2029, while Google pledged $15 billion for AI infrastructure and data centers in October.

"One of the things that I look for is what's happening here," said Russell Grandinetti, Amazon's senior VP of international stores, speaking at the company's Smbhav event in New Delhi. "That's inevitably going to become part of how we run our business around the world."

## Market Challenges

Despite its scale advantages—including a vast logistics network and over 1.7 million sellers—Amazon faces fierce competition in India. The company competes with Walmart-backed Flipkart, rising star Meesho, and quick-commerce platforms like Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit, and Zepto, all vying for the same urban consumer base.

India's appeal extends beyond traditional tech companies. AI firms including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity have also shown interest in the market, attracted by the growing developer base and accelerating adoption of generative AI applications.

The investment underscores India's position as a critical battleground for global technology companies seeking growth in emerging markets.
