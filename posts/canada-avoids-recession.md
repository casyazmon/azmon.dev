**Ottawa** — In a turn of events that has surprised economists and policymakers alike, Canada has successfully avoided a recession, with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showing a significant climb in the third quarter of 2025.

The latest data from Statistics Canada reveals that the economy grew at an annualized rate that surpassed the Bank of Canada's expectations. This growth comes as a relief to many who feared that high interest rates and global economic uncertainty would tip the country into a downturn.

## Key Drivers of Growth

Several sectors contributed to this positive performance:
*   **Export Strength:** Strong demand for Canadian natural resources and manufactured goods.
*   **Consumer Spending:** Despite inflationary pressures, household spending remained robust.
*   **Business Investment:** Increased investment in technology and green energy projects.

"This is a testament to the resilience of the Canadian economy," said a senior economist at a major bank. "While challenges remain, the data suggests we are on a more stable footing than previously thought."

The Bank of Canada is expected to take this new data into account at its next interest rate announcement, potentially signaling a shift in monetary policy strategy moving forward.
