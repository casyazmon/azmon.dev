**Edmonton** — A newly signed pipeline deal between the federal government and the province of Alberta has ignited a firestorm of political controversy, culminating in the resignation of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault.

The agreement, which aims to expand energy infrastructure and increase export capacity, was signed yesterday by Mark Carney on behalf of the federal government. While proponents argue it is essential for economic security, it has faced fierce opposition from environmental groups and some political factions.

## Political Fallout

The deal received a mixed reception immediately upon its announcement. At the Alberta United Conservative Party (UCP) convention, the mention of the federal involvement was met with boos, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between Edmonton and Ottawa.

However, the most significant shockwave came from within the federal cabinet itself. Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmental activist turned politician, tendered his resignation shortly after the deal was inked. In a brief statement, Guilbeault cited "irreconcilable differences" regarding the government's direction on climate policy.

"I cannot in good conscience support a path that locks us further into fossil fuel dependency," Guilbeault stated.

The Prime Minister has accepted the resignation and is expected to announce a cabinet shuffle in the coming days.
